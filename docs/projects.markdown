This is an archive of my projects, broken into shorter (bite size) and longer (king size) projects.

### King Size

#### [MapReduce](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/MapReduce)
A C implementation of the map-(combine-)reduce framework discussed in the seminal paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (J Dean, S Ghemawat 2004).

#### _[eBack](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/eBack)_

A Linux backup utility written in C and the Bash scripting language.  This utility is intended to speed up large-scale, local file backups by leveraging multiple external drives.

### Bite Size
