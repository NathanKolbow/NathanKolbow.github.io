This is an archive of my projects, broken into larger (king size) and smaller (bite size) projects.

## King Size

#### _[Regression Analysis Paper](/docs/yelp-writeup.pdf)_
This is my final report for STAT 333: Applied Regression Analysis.  This report was deemed exceptional enough to be awarded a score of 100% and was used to show other students in the course what an ideal report looks like.  The analyses were done in R, and their code can be found in the project's GitHub repo here.

#### _[MapReduce](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/MapReduce)_
A C implementation of the map-(combine-)reduce framework discussed in the seminal paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (J Dean, S Ghemawat 2004).

#### _[eBack](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/eBack)_
A Linux backup utility written in C and the Bash scripting language.  This utility is intended to speed up large-scale, local file backups by leveraging multiple external drives.
