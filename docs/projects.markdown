This is an archive of my projects, broken into larger (king size) and smaller (bite size) projects.

## King Size

#### _[Regression Analysis Paper](/docs/yelp-writeup.pdf)_
This is my final report for _STAT 333: Applied Regression Analysis_.  This report was deemed exceptional enough to be awarded a score of 100% and was used to show other students in the course what an ideal report looks like.  The analyses were done in R, and all of the code for the report can be found in its GitHub repo [here]().

#### _[MapReduce](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/MapReduce)_
A C implementation of the map-(combine-)reduce framework discussed in the seminal paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (J Dean, S Ghemawat 2004).

#### _[eBack](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/eBack)_
A Linux backup utility written in C and the Bash scripting language.  This utility is intended to speed up large-scale, local file backups by leveraging multiple external drives.

#### _[Chess Match Analyzer](https://github.com/NathanKolbow/Chess-Match-Analyzer)
Stockfish is an open source, world class chess AI that is widely used both in human vs. AI gameplay as well as AI vs. AI gameplay.  This program uses Stockfish to help users improve their chess skills.  By providing move-by-move feedback on full chess games, users can see how the pendulum of control swang throughout the match.
